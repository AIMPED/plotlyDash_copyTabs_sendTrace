# CopyTabs & SendTrace
This repository contains the `python` code for an app using `dash`.

## Description
The original app was set-up as multipage app with a static upper section for each page. The OP wanted to enable duplication of the **main** tab on one of the pages.  
He also wnated to include a functionality to send traces of a chart displayed in the main tab to a selected tab. This selection is hidden in a offcanvas.
The specification of the app can be found [here](https://community.plotly.com/t/one-time-job-add-tab-duplication-functionality-to-existing-app/80036).

I created a mock- up which uses [dash-bootstrap-components](http://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/) for minimal styling.
